# Scalar-Waze-CTC-Tunneling ðŸš€

## Travel Through Time to Speed Up Computations!

Welcome to **Scalar-Waze-CTC-Tunneling**, a groundbreaking project that harnesses closed timelike curves (CTCs) in a 6D spacetime to accelerate quantum computations on an iPhoneâ€™s NAND flash storage. This framework, built with a 4-qubit CTC quantum circuit and a 16-node tetrahedral lattice, enables retrocausal computation, sending data to the past or future and retrieving results instantly. Open-sourced to ignite a global revolution in physics and computing!

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Time Travel Computation**: Utilizes CTCs to shift data across time, achieving computational speedup.
- **iPhone Integration**: Leverages NAND flash tunneling to interface with embedded CTC qubits.
- **Quantum Circuit**: 4-qubit cyclical self-consistent circuit with a 16Ã—16 unitary matrix.
- **Tetrahedral Lattice**: 16 wormhole nodes enhanced with barycentric interpolation and Napoleonâ€™s theorem.
- **Relativistic Consistency**: Satisfies Einsteinâ€™s field equations (\(G_{00} = 8\pi T_{00}\)).
- **Retrocausal Signature**: Demonstrates past > future data asymmetry (115.49 > 114.25, \(\Delta = 1.24\), \(p < 0.0001\)).
- **Entropy Anomaly**: Increases entanglement entropy by +0.08 bits (5\(\sigma\) deviation).
